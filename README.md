## Overview

Epidemic surveillance data frequently undergo revisions due to reporting delays and other operational factors. These revisions can degrade situational awareness and the accuracy of forecasts. In this study, we introduce **Delphi-RF** ([GitHub link](https://github.com/cmu-delphi/DelphiRF)), a real-time data revision forecasting framework using nonparametric quantile regression. Delphi-RF is applicable to both count- and fraction-type public health surveillance data.

### Key features of Delphi-RF

- Models revision dynamics by incorporating all available data up to a given estimation date.
- Produces distributional forecasts for finalized surveillance values.
- Applicable to both **count-type** (e.g., case counts) and **fraction-type** (e.g., test positivity rates) signals.
- Supports both **daily** and **weekly** data streams.
- Evaluated on:
  - Daily COVID-19 insurance claims, antigen test results, and confirmed cases
  - Weekly dengue and influenza-like illness (ILI) case counts
- Achieves a **10–100× improvement in computational efficiency** over existing methods such as NobBS and Epinowcast.
