\caption{\emph{\textbf{Runtime comparison across methods for daily data at different training windows.}
This table presents the mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) for computing time (in seconds) required by different forecasting methods, applied to daily COVID-19 datasets. Results are reported per reference date and location. Models are trained and used to generate forecasts every 30 days for CHNG insurance claims data and every 7 days for MA-DPH confirmed case data. The comparison is performed under two training window settings (180 and 365 days), with all other configurations held constant to ensure a fair evaluation of runtime differences across methods.}}

\section{Complete Set of DelphiRF Revision Forecasts by Reference Date}

Figures S2â€“S51 present DelphiRF revision forecasts for CHNG-provided insurance claims data at lag 7 across all 50 U.S. states. The model is re-trained every 30 days using training windows of 180 and 365 days, respectively. The format follows that of Figures 5 and 6 in the main text.
